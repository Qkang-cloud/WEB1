      <h2>WEB이란 무엇인가?</h2>
      <p>The World Wide Web (also known as WWW, W3, or simply the Web)[1] is an information system that enables content sharing over the Internet through user-friendly ways meant to appeal to users beyond IT specialists and hobbyists.[2] It allows documents and other web resources to be accessed over the Internet according to specific rules of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).[3]
        The Web was invented by English computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee while at CERN in 1989 and opened to the public in 1993. </p>
